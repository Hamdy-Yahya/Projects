A black-jack inspired game where a user wages an ammount to compete against a computer to see who draws the highest card.

The application makes use of objects and classes to generate a deck of cards, and to give them respected ranking values.
The game begins with a prompt asking the user if they would like to play or not. The user begins with $100 and cannot bet more than what they own.
If the user chooses to play, then they are aksed how much they would like to bet. 
After submitting an amount, the cards are revealed and the higher number card wins, if the numbers are equall then the suit decides the winner 
(Spades > Hearts > Diamonds > Clubs).

The Hackathon objective was to review, refactor, and implement code to create a card game using Java language. 

The application is coded on Spring Tool Suite and executed through the console.
